title: Radiance Color-Theme for Emacs
---

I've created a color-theme that should integrate nicely into a desktop
using Ubuntu's Radiance theme.

I think it looks pretty neat. Below is a screenshot with the code for
the theme in an Emacs buffer.

You can get it from its [GitHub repository][github]. Contributions are
very much welcome. If your language of choice doesn't look good,
please create an issue or send me a pull request.
