title: How I set up my Blog
---

I've decided to keep a blog to remind myself of the things I'm doing
and learning. Someone else *might* also benefit from that as
well. Since I've become somewhat of a Ruby enthusiast, I decided to
use [Jekyll][].

## What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll][] is a static site generator written in Ruby by Tom
Preston-Werner(of [GitHub][] fame). You create a set of templates and
then just write your posts in plain text using your
markup of choice(I use [Markdown][]). Jekyll then transforms everything
into static HTML that can be served by pretty much anything you like.

The nice thing about everything being plain text is that I can use
Emacs to write posts. It has a very nice markdown-mode. I use [Git][]
to push everything into a [GitHub][] repository so I backup both my
code *and* my content. You are free to browse everything [here][1]

## Design

My goal was to have a clean design that makes it pleasant to read what
I write. I use [Calluna Sans][cs] served by [typekit][]. Calluna Sans
is a very nice humanist sans-serif typeface made by [Jos
Buivegna][jb]. You should definitely check out his other fonts. Code
is, or rather will be, typeset in [<span
class="inconsolata">Inconsolata</span>][i]. Everything follows a
vertical rhythm which I think looks very pleasing.

If you're using Firefox 4, you can see some advanced
typographical features such as small caps and ligatures turned on here
and there.

If you have comments of any kind, I would be glad to hear from you.
