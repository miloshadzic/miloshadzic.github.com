I think it's probably better that I don't write design details of my
blog. I like to fiddle with the looks and it will make some of my posts
outdated too fast.

Currently I'm using [League Gothic][1] for headers, Lucida Grande for body
text and Monaco for code. If you haven't got those two, you get to see
similarly paired fonts for your system.
