#About

Hello, my name is Milo≈° and I live in Belgrade. I am currently writing Ruby at [Rendered Text](http://renderedtext.com). You can reach me at [milos.hadzic@gmail.com](mailto:me@miloshadzic.com).

I write something pretty much every day on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/miloshadzic). Usually about software development or design. I use [GitHub](http://github.com/miloshadzic) to host my code and blog. I love reading and I've recently started a [reading list](/reading) that has comments on the books I've read. If you're more into music, you can check out what I like to listen to on my [Last.fm page](http://last.fm/user/nagnatron).
