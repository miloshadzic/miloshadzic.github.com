    <p>Hey I'm Miloš. I run <a href="https://rightfold.io">Right Fold</a> — a small web consultancy. If you need help you with your current or upcoming project we're currently accepting new work so it's the right time to reach out.</p>
    <p>I'm also somewhat involved with underground club music in Belgrade, mostly as a member of the <a href="https://facebook.com/thatmysticfeed">Mystic Stylez</a> collective. We host some pretty good parties. There's a little log of parties I play on <a href='https://ello.co/miloshadzic'>ello</a>.</p>
    <p>This place used to host my blog but I've barely wrote anything in years. The old links should still work though.</p> 
    <p>Check out my <a href='https://instagram.com/miloshadzic'>Instagram</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/miloshadzic'>Twitter</a> and <a href='https://github.com/miloshadzic'>Github</a> for more.</p>
    <p>Get in touch by <a href="mailto:milos@rightfold.io">email</a>.</p>
