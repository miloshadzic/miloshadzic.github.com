    <p class="date ">November - December 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>Excellent but very dense book on JavaScript. Not recommended as a first book on JavaScript but definitely if you intend to write any significant amount of js code.</p>

    <span class="italic">Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson<br /></span>

    <p class="date ">August 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>This is my second time reading Rework. I&#39;ve first read an electronic copy but I&#39;ve now bought a hardback copy because It&#39;s my favourite business book. It&#39;s also beautifully illustrated and nicely made.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 37signals&#39;s thinking distilled in about 80 essays on a variety of topics. Recently I&#39;ve become fed up with overly long and wordy books. The authors pride themselves on keeping it really short and to the point.</p>

    <p class="date ">June - August 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>I&#39;ve heard about this book but never really considered reading it because I thought that I don&#39;t need a book about one testing tool.</p>

<p>It turns out that this book should have been named &quot;The BDD Book&quot; because It&#39;s more about the BDD workflow than it is about RSpec. That said, It does go into significant detail with RSpec and I liked that part the most.</p>

    <p class="date ">June - July 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>I really liked this Rails tutorial-book because it drives the sample application with RSpec.</p>

    <span class="italic">Christopher Alexander<br /></span>

    <p class="date ">June 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>I got interested in this book after watching Ryan Singer&#39;s talk about it. I decided to read it after noticing that almost all of the well known OO design thinkers either recommend it or mention it as one of their inspirations.</p>

<p>This is a book about the process of design. About finding what you need to design and how it fits within it&#39;s &quot;context&quot;. Most examples are from architecture, urbanism and industrial design but this book really is about design in general. It&#39;s not hard to see how you could apply parts of this process to the design of your software.</p>

    <p class="date ">May - June 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>This is a nice book for people who would like an introduction to TDD. That said, I thought that it could have been replaced by two screencasts and a book of about 50 pages. It has a lot of &quot;filler&quot; material which is a bit annoying. I think I expected a bit more but overall it&#39;s an interesting read.</p>
