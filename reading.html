  <span class="title">Comment:</span><br /> <span class="bookcomment">This is a nice book for people who would like an introduction to TDD. That said, I thought that it could have been replaced by two screencasts and a book of about 50 pages. It has a lot of "filler" material which is a bit annoying. I think I expected a bit more but overall it's an interesting read.</span>

  <span class="title">Comment:</span><br /> <span class="bookcomment">Awesome book about how Ruby is actually used and how to avoid "programming Java in Ruby". It is somewhat similar to Effective Java. It took me a while to read it but it is a quick read. The perfect second Ruby book.</span>
