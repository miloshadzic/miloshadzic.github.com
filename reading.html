    <div class='bookcomment'><p>This is my second time reading Rework. I've first read an electronic copy but I've now bought a hardback copy because It's my favourite business book. It's also beautifully illustrated and nicely made.</p>

<p>It's 37signals's thinking distilled in about 80 essays on a variety of topics. Recently I've become fed up with overly long and wordy books. The authors pride themselves on keeping it really short and to the point.</p>

    <p class="date ">June - August 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>I've heard about this book but never really considered reading it because I thought that I don't need a book about one testing tool.</p>

<p>It turns out that this book should have been named &quot;The BDD Book&quot; because It's more about the BDD workflow than it is about RSpec. That said, It does go into significant detail with RSpec and I liked that part the most.</p>

    <div class='bookcomment'><p>I got interested in this book after watching Ryan Singer's talk about it. I decided to read it after noticing that almost all of the well known OO design thinkers either recommend it or mention it as one of their inspirations.</p>

<p>This is a book about the process of design. About finding what you need to design and how it fits within it's &quot;context&quot;. Most examples are from architecture, urbanism and industrial design but this book really is about design in general. It's not hard to see how you could apply parts of this process to the design of your software.</p>

    <p class="date ">May - June 2011</p>
    <div class='bookcomment'><p>This is a nice book for people who would like an introduction to TDD. That said, I thought that it could have been replaced by two screencasts and a book of about 50 pages. It has a lot of &quot;filler&quot; material which is a bit annoying. I think I expected a bit more but overall it's an interesting read.</p>

    <div class='bookcomment'><p>Awesome book about how Ruby is actually used and how to avoid &quot;programming Java in Ruby&quot;. It is somewhat similar to Effective Java. It took me a while to read it but it is a quick read. The perfect second Ruby book.</p>
