I've heard about this book but never really considered reading it because I thought that I don't need a book about one testing tool.

It turns out that this book should have been named "The BDD Book" because It's more about the BDD workflow than it is about RSpec. That said, It does go into significant detail with RSpec and I liked that part the most.
