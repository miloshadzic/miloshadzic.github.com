I got interested in this book after watching Ryan Singer's talk about it. I decided to read it after noticing that almost all of the well known OO design thinkers either recommend it or mention it as one of their inspirations.

This is a book about the process of design. About finding what you need to design and how it fits within it's "context". Most examples are from architecture, urbanism and industrial design but this book really is about design in general. It's not hard to see how you could apply parts of this process to the design of your software.
