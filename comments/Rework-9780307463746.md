This is my second time reading Rework. I've first read an electronic copy but I've now bought a hardback copy because It's my favourite business book. It's also beautifully illustrated and nicely made.

It's 37signals's thinking distilled in about 80 essays on a variety of topics. Recently I've become fed up with overly long and wordy books. The authors pride themselves on keeping it really short and to the point.
